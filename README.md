## Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my selected solutions to the problems on the site https://projecteuler.net/. Project Euler allows users to only publish solutions to the first one hundred problems, so only solutions to these problems are posted here. As of August 2025, I have solved a total of 109 problems on Project Euler, placing me in the top 1% (0.979%) of the 1.35+ million users and earning me the One Percenter award.
